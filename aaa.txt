\f0  What can we do

\cf2 We add each other's items to each other's product master database. This is a way to make little change to the current system.\
Because we do not make changes mostly
\f1 ,
\f0  initial cost will be lower. However
\f1 ,
\f0  the running cost is high because two sites are running.\
And although it is customer stress
\f1 ,
\f0  nothing changes for customers in this plan. So nothing.\
\
Sorry for the radical comments
\f1 ,
\f0  we stop the Comtech site and integrate it on the PCS site.\
The initial cost increases because one site will respond to requests from both Japan and the United States. Also
\f1 ,
\f0  the cost of migration is not cheap.\
However
\f1 ,
\f0  considering that it will continue for decades from now
\f1 ,
\f0  it is always expensive to make similar updates to both sites.\
Unfortunately
\f1 ,
\f0  if the identity of the customer of PCS and Comptech overlap
\f1 ,
\f0  Comptech's customers has to re-register.\

\cf2 We propose a system integration plan\
It is because the long-term cost is low and synergistic effect can be expected\
However
\f1 ,
\f0  there are problems that can not be ignored
\f1 ,
\f0  such as initial cost and customer's stress on Comptech\
\
First of all
\f1 ,
\f0  we will implement a point-back campaign.\
It is aimed at overcoming the stress that Comptech customers stop using the familiar site and use the new PCS site.\
We will give ten times more points to those who moved from Comptech to PCS during the transition period of three months.\
It seems like a big cost for a three-month point 10 times. However
\f1 ,
\f0  the total cost will be higher by running cost
\f1 ,
\f0  taking longer transition period.\

\cf2 In order to sell our goods in the US
\f1 ,
\f0  we need to add these online payment options to our EC site.\
PayPal and ApplePay are already in widespread use in Japan and have already been applied on our site
\f1 ,
\f0  but recently Venmo is very popular in the USA
\f1 ,
\f0  so we plan to apply it.}
